When a word or temporal sentence is in context an existing graph may exist in a pre-computed sandbox of graphs (such as a module), and can assist with contextual information. The sentence "I only need a few" - defines a request for a small number of _the_ items. Namely three items. The system will alsoready maintain a 'number' module and graph - working its own procedures to flag cardinal numbers within a temporal input stream.

The reasoning or weighting module will utilize the given meta data regarding 'few' and note it's value of 'three' `3`.

The 'number' graph is available to all other modules/graphs for referencing. When a word , such as 'few', 'count' or 'one' reside within the 'number' graph. Using a word connected to the graph should automatically event flag some usage; along with a primary weight for the reasoning to understand.

When an entire graph is generated by another module or some event, this 'number' graph reacts with an event. When applying "I have some maybe more", the words 'some' and 'more' a edgenodes within the 'number' graph. It should fire events and pepper meta data into the strings _current context_
