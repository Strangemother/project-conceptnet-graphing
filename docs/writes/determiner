# Dermininer

A determiner is an important case with the _context_ of the API. A determiner
can explicity define context within a set case.

Examples of determiner:


    all an another any both del each either every half la many much nary
    neither no some such that the them these this those

    the


Some determiners are easy:

+ the cake
+ all dogs
+ every house

When applied in context a determiner provides enough _context_ to derive a context
chain of works and context references.
