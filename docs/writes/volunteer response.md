[concept]


In many occasions we need the machine to freely provide information in and out of the _current_ context. This occurs for internal graph corrections and populating graph mandates. A quick example

In a previous session 'up' graphed 'down' as an opposite and a Trueism can define a fact.

    OP: Up in down
    CTX: No
    CTX: Up antonym down

Firstly the statement is a direct statement therefore the weighting is strong. The context graph maps a competing graph to the exact statement as an antonym.

For weighted graphs with a result leaf of a context object - therefore resolving something already trained - the system should assert the fact as a unit of fact.

If the statement is true - CTX should reply with an affirmative or an agreement.

    OP: The sky is blue
    CTX: [confirmed | affirmed | agreed | yes]

'sky' has already been graphed (very nicely) and a lot of references to 'blue' exist within the context. therefore a strong graph generates for blue sky. In this case the system should provide an assertion.
