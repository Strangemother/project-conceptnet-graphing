# Truism

A Truism states the obvious or hardly mentionable. To define a truism we can
associate synonyms or disctint factuals through the API; not to define factual
statements of context, moreso the affirmation of contextually defined associations.

> The statement "1 is 1" is useless. But the statement "one is 1" is useful.

We infer the statement: To a machine a truism may not nessaserily be true.
Or more correctly - a true statement may be trained to a true false; a statement
we would like to train as a none truism of which is considered true fact.

The concept of True / False cannot exist in a full weighted tree.
In the skynet thought-experiment - _good_ is not a grey concept.
Therefore to provide context to _true_, none explicit truisms can train a
weighted net for base factual or _distintive truisms_.


# distinctive truism

A true truism applying a factual statement through the same statement.
In itself a distinct statement is valid. Applied through a truism statement
becomes worthless.

Given the statement "one" or "1" does not derive any contextual relevance.
The existence of the statement is worthless.

The statement "1 == 1" is a distinctive truism. The statement without equation
was worthless. Attempting to determin an expression on a self-referencing
statement is useful for distant tree validation on two parts through an expression
(but essentially has no valid statement) to yield.


# inconspicuos truism

A discreet (not discrete) truism, defining a factual statement through derived truisms

+ The sky is blue
+ one is 1
+ up is not down
+ good is not always good
+ maybe doesn't mean no, but it doesn't mean yes.


# indescriminete truism

A truism to exist without judgement does not exist.

> indiscriminate - done at random or without careful judgement.

A statement of truism may be obvious but the statement exists due to selective
descrimination of synonms. Such as "Green is green" is truism but is also tautology.
This fact was derived from defining other colours and having a relevant index when
analyzing _said_ 'green'.

Although obvious; "a truism is not an accident".
