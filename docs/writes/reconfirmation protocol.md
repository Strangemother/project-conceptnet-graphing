The reconfirmation protocol
The reconfirmation protocol provides a level of assurance through a context chain for agreeance on critical actions, and their fundamental confirmation. It should happen at the very base of context chain growth, allowing operation on a simple positive or negative. The goal is natural input, herefore weâ€™ll drive the scenario in a similar way.

The first input should be to initiate the reconfirmation protocol. Upon which the system will respond with a hard coded response of activation followed by locking of expecting input values affirm to only positive or negative. Upon each input - the system will parrot the context result, followed by confirmation of the result. This again is only in a form of positive or negative.

The flow should proceed

The reconfirmation protocol is active. Context receives affirmations to the positive or negative only. Upon the 5th and final response from the system, the reconfirmation protocol will release and the assigned action will be performed. This will require 6 consecutive positive answers from the operator
Any affirmation to the negative will end the protocol and resume normal operation.
